# Config Specification

zentinel config is explicit, deterministic, and stable. The default config should work for conventional Zig projects while allowing advanced projects to opt into experimental behavior.

## File Name

Preferred config file:

```text
zentinel.toml
```

The CLI may accept an explicit path:

```bash
zentinel run --config path/to/zentinel.toml
```

## Minimal Config

```toml config
[project]
name = "example"

[test]
commands = ["zig build test"]
```

## TOML Subset

Phase 0 config parsing uses the deterministic in-tree TOML subset required by `docs/DEPENDENCY_POLICY.md`.

Supported syntax:

- tables such as `[project]`
- string values
- boolean values
- integer values
- arrays of strings
- comments beginning with `#`

Unsupported TOML syntax must fail with `ZNTL_CONFIG_PARSE_ERROR` or `ZNTL_CONFIG_INVALID_VALUE`; agents must not add a TOML dependency only to support syntax outside this subset.

## Full Config Example

```toml config
# zentinel.toml - mutation testing config. See docs/CONFIG_SPEC.md.

# Project source set and identity.
[project]
# Human-readable project name.
name = "example"
# Project root, relative to this config file.
root = "."
# Glob patterns for source files eligible for mutation.
include = ["src/**/*.zig"]
# Paths excluded from mutation.
exclude = [".zig-cache/**", "zig-out/**", "test/**"]

# Zig toolchain policy.
[zig]
# Only accepted Zig policy version for this zentinel release.
version = "0.16.0"
# Optimization/safety modes to run: Debug, ReleaseSafe, ReleaseFast, ReleaseSmall.
modes = ["Debug"]

# Mutation backend selection.
[backend]
# Primary backend (ast is the stable default).
default = "ast"
# Additional experimental backends to opt into (e.g. zir).
experimental = []

# Enabled mutation operators (see docs/MUTATOR_SPEC.md).
[mutators]
# Operator names, or a group: phase1, phase2, all_stable.
enabled = [
  "arithmetic_add_sub",
  "arithmetic_mul_div",
  "equality_swap",
  "comparison_boundary",
  "logical_and_or",
  "boolean_literal"
]

# Baseline and mutation test execution.
[test]
# Baseline and mutation test commands (parsed to argv, no shell).
commands = ["zig build test"]
# Test selection: same_file_then_package, same_file, package, or all.
selection = "same_file_then_package"
# Per-command timeout in milliseconds.
timeout_ms = 30000
# Reserved baseline policy flag; report v1 requires baselines to run.
baseline_required = true

# Mutation run execution.
[run]
# Maximum worker count (1 is the deterministic serial default).
jobs = 1

# Deterministic result cache.
[cache]
# Enable cache reads and writes.
enabled = true
# Cache storage path.
directory = ".zig-cache/zentinel"

# Report output.
[report]
# Report formats to emit: text, json, jsonl, junit.
formats = ["text", "json"]
# Report artifact directory.
output_dir = "zig-out/zentinel"

# Advisory AI (opt-in; disabled by default).
[ai]
# Enable AI commands or advisory report enrichment.
enabled = false
# Provider: disabled, stub, local, or remote.
provider = "disabled"
# Must be true before persisted config may select provider = "remote".
remote_allowed = false
# Lines of source context before/after a mutant for prompts.
source_context_lines = 4
# Regex patterns redacted from prompt payloads.
redact_patterns = ["(?i)api[_-]?key", "(?i)token"]
```

## Validation Failures

Selecting an experimental backend without an explicit opt-in is rejected:

```toml config_fail
[backend]
default = "zir"
```

```text output contains
ZNTL_CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL_BACKEND
```

An unknown section or key is rejected:

```toml config_fail
[project]
bogus = "x"
```

```text output contains
ZNTL_CONFIG_UNKNOWN_KEY
```

## Project Section

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | string | directory name | Human-readable project name. |
| `root` | string | `.` | Project root relative to config file. |
| `include` | list(string) | `["src/**/*.zig"]` | Source files eligible for mutation. |
| `exclude` | list(string) | `[".zig-cache/**", "zig-out/**", "test/**"]` | Paths excluded from mutation. |

Paths are interpreted relative to project root and normalized to `/`.

The default exclude list is exact for v1. Agents must not silently add or remove defaults such as `.git/**` without an explicit task or ADR, because exclude expansion changes candidate discovery and cache keys.

## Zig Section

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `version` | string | `0.16.0` | Only accepted policy value for this zentinel version. |
| `modes` | list(enum) | `["Debug"]` | Zig optimization/safety modes to execute. |

Allowed modes:

```text
Debug
ReleaseSafe
ReleaseFast
ReleaseSmall
```

Multiple `zig.modes` entries are accepted and drive the safety-mode matrix. An explicit empty `modes = []` is rejected with `ZNTL_CONFIG_INVALID_VALUE` (omitting `modes` keeps the `Debug` default).

## Backend Section

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `default` | enum | `ast` | Primary backend. |
| `experimental` | list(enum) | `[]` | Additional experimental backends. |

Allowed backend values:

```text
ast
zir
```

`zir` is rejected unless explicitly listed in `experimental` or selected by an experimental CLI flag. The experimental CLI backend flag is `list-mutants --backend zir`. (The `air` backend was retired: AIR-level mutation mapping is infeasible without Zig's `Sema` stage.)

## Mutators Section

`enabled` is a list of operator names from `docs/MUTATOR_SPEC.md`.

Special values:

```text
phase1
phase2
all_stable
```

Expansion must be deterministic and tested.

`phase2` expands only to stable Phase 2 operators. Preview Phase 2 operators are **not yet enableable**: they have no pipeline collector, so config validation rejects any non-stable operator — whether named directly or pulled in by a group. `all_stable` means every stable operator whose owning implementation is complete.

## Test Section

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `commands` | list(string) | `["zig build test"]` | Baseline and mutation test commands. |
| `selection` | enum | `same_file_then_package` | Test selection strategy: one of `same_file_then_package`, `same_file`, `package`, `all`. |
| `timeout_ms` | integer | `30000` | Per-command timeout in milliseconds. Must be a positive integer (`<= 0` is rejected: a value of 0 disables the timeout and would leave hung tests unbounded). |
| `baseline_required` | bool | `true` | Reserved baseline policy flag; report v1 requires baselines to run. |

Command strings are parsed by zentinel into argv without invoking a shell. The shared parser belongs to the deterministic core module `src/command.zig`; `zentinel check` validates with it, and the runner executes exactly the argv shape it returns.

Config parsing validates that `test.commands` is a non-empty list of non-empty strings; full command grammar validation lives in `src/command.zig`. Command strings are preserved after shape validation rather than re-parsed by a second parser.

`impact_graph` is **reserved but not yet accepted** as a `test.selection` value: config validation currently rejects it. Its planned deterministic impact-set semantics are described in `docs/TEST_SELECTION.md`; until the resolver lands, use one of the accepted strategies above.

The shared command parser accepts this grammar:

```text
command        = spacing? field (spacing+ field)* spacing?
field          = bare | single_quoted | double_quoted
bare           = bare_char+
bare_char      = any non-spacing character except quotes, backslash, or rejected shell metacharacters
single_quoted  = "'" quoted_part* "'"
double_quoted  = '"' quoted_part* '"'
quoted_part    = quoted_char | escape
quoted_char    = any character except quote delimiters, backslash, or rejected shell metacharacters
escape         = backslash escaped_char
escaped_char   = backslash | single_quote | double_quote | space
spacing        = one or more ASCII spaces or tabs
```

Semantics:

- parsing produces a non-empty argv array
- `argv[0]` must be non-empty
- empty quoted fields are valid only after `argv[0]`
- quoting only groups literal text; it does not enable shell expansion
- backslash escaping is valid only inside quoted fields and only for `\`, `'`, `"`, and a literal space
- unmatched quotes, trailing escapes, and unsupported escapes are invalid command syntax

The parser rejects shell features instead of approximating them:

- pipes: `|`
- redirects: `<`, `>`
- command substitution or variable expansion: `$`, backtick
- glob expansion: `*`, `?`, `[`, `]`, `{`, `}`
- environment-variable assignment prefixes such as `FOO=bar zig test`
- command grouping or subshell syntax: `(`, `)`
- command chaining such as `&&`, `||`, or `;`

Rejected shell metacharacters are invalid even when quoted or escaped. The goal is deterministic argv construction, not shell compatibility.

`zentinel check` validates command strings with this parser but does not execute them. The baseline and mutant runners must not implement alternate shell-like parsing.

`baseline_required = false` is reserved for a future cache-backed baseline-skip policy. Until a later ADR or task defines the required fresh-cache proof and report schema, config validation must reject `false` with `ZNTL_CONFIG_INVALID_VALUE`. Report v1 writers must run the baseline or emit `run.status = "baseline_failed"` when it fails.

## Run Section

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `jobs` | integer | `1` | Maximum zentinel worker count for mutation execution. |

`jobs = 1` is the deterministic serial default. Values greater than `1` request bounded parallel mutation execution on the worker pool. The command-line `--jobs <n>` option overrides normalized `run.jobs` only for the current invocation.

Config validation must reject non-positive worker counts with `ZNTL_CONFIG_INVALID_VALUE`.

## Cache Section

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `enabled` | bool | `true` | Enables deterministic cache. |
| `directory` | string | `.zig-cache/zentinel` | Cache storage path. |

## Report Section

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `formats` | list(enum) | `["text", "json"]` | Report formats to emit. |
| `output_dir` | string | `zig-out/zentinel` | Report artifact directory. |

## AI Section

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `enabled` | bool | `false` | Enables AI commands or advisory report enrichment. |
| `provider` | enum | `disabled` | `disabled`, `stub`, `local`, or `remote`. |
| `remote_allowed` | bool | `false` | Must be `true` before persisted config may select `provider = "remote"`. |
| `source_context_lines` | integer | `4` | Lines before/after mutant for prompts. |
| `redact_patterns` | list(string) | `["(?i)api[_-]?key", "(?i)token"]` | Regex patterns to redact. |

The v1 redaction default list is exact. Omitted `redact_patterns` normalizes to `["(?i)api[_-]?key", "(?i)token"]`; agents must not silently add broader patterns without an explicit docs and snapshot update because redaction changes prompt payloads.

## Validation Rules

Config validation must reject:

- unknown top-level sections
- unknown keys
- unsupported Zig version values
- experimental backend without opt-in
- negative timeouts
- `baseline_required = false`
- empty test command list
- invalid test command syntax
- `ai.provider = "remote"` unless `ai.remote_allowed = true`, reported as `ZNTL_CONFIG_INVALID_VALUE`
- output directory outside project root unless explicitly allowed by future policy
- mutator names not defined in `MUTATOR_SPEC.md`
- non-positive worker counts

The CLI `--output <path>` override inherits this same project-root restriction as `report.output_dir`; CLI and config output paths must not diverge on sandbox boundary behavior.

Validation errors should include the config path and key.

AI command-line overrides are validated after config normalization. Passing `--ai-provider remote` while the normalized config has `remote_allowed = false` fails with `ZNTL_AI_PROVIDER_NOT_ALLOWED`; a persisted config that directly selects `provider = "remote"` with `remote_allowed = false` fails config validation with `ZNTL_CONFIG_INVALID_VALUE`.
